## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Java Script


### What I learned

I learned how to create optimized code, going through all the application buttons, how to reduce code repetition, and increase reuse, making this code easier to maintain.


### Continuous development
Constantly overcoming challenges is what motivates me, with each step, with each challenge overcome I feel fulfilled, I am continuing in search of new horizons.
